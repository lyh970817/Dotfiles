The Treepata icons are designed and developed by
Paul Santman <treepata@gmail.com> at www.treepata.nl

This variant of the High Contrast icon set for the Xfce desktop uses
my own work, as well as the work by the XFCE High Contrast icon theme 
developers, the XFCE elementary icon theme developers, ALLBLACK icon 
set by Mandarancid and 042 icon theme by Heylove. My gratitude and
due credit goes to these developers for their wonderful contributions.
