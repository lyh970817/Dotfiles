# Todo

* A make link script for testing after change

* Rebuild st - the files are automatically deleted after make install so config.h is not kept

* What are the XF86 keys?

* Why copy output in st not working? Get a customized st build. (Remberm to put in font)

* R lintr disable variable name linting

* Python formatter install

* Change file permission

* Write a automatic install function
